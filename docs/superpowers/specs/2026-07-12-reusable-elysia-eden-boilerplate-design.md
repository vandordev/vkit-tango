# Reusable Elysia Eden Boilerplate Design

## Goal

Convert this repository into a reusable, domain-neutral Bun/Turborepo boilerplate. Its runtime apps are the Elysia API, Next.js web app, scheduler, and worker. The sole application HTTP transport is Elysia under `/api`, consumed by Next.js through Eden Treaty. The template contains no task-management, Sleekflow, authentication, or SSO domain code.

## Scope

This change removes the existing tRPC, Next.js internal API routes, SSO/auth integration, Sleekflow persistence, and task-management-specific documentation. It retains the Bun, Turbo, Next.js, Elysia, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Mantine, and TanStack Query foundations where they support the new architecture. A PostgreSQL-backed queue is included as the default asynchronous-processing foundation.

The web app exposes public pages in `app/(public)` and dashboard pages in `app/(dashboard)`. These are route-group organization boundaries only; authentication is not included in the boilerplate.

## Architecture

### Workspace ownership

- `apps/api` owns the Elysia application, HTTP transport, API validation, API response mapping, request IDs, logging, CORS, and health endpoints.
- `apps/web` owns Next.js routes, UI, and Eden consumers. It never imports Prisma, the database package, or application usecases.
- `apps/scheduler` owns time-based scheduling. It enqueues named jobs but does not execute business logic.
- `apps/worker` owns asynchronous job consumption. It invokes application usecases and owns worker retry, idempotency, and job-execution logging concerns.
- `packages/database` owns the Prisma schema, migrations, generated client, and the singleton `prisma` client.
- `packages/application` owns write-side usecases and domain rules. It may depend on `@repo/database`, but does not import Elysia or Next.js.
- `packages/config` owns shared server configuration schemas and typed config loaders for non-Next runtimes.
- `.agent` owns durable contributor and agent guidance. Its documents are the source of truth for this template's architecture.

### API and Eden

All business endpoints live in Elysia beneath `/api`. `/health` and `/health/ready` remain operational endpoints outside that namespace.

`apps/api/src/index.ts` exports both `app` and `type App = typeof app`. The server runtime is separate, so importing `App` into the web app does not listen on a port.

`apps/web/app/api/[[...slugs]]/route.ts` embeds the Elysia app by exporting `app.fetch` for supported HTTP methods. `apps/web/lib/api` creates typed Eden clients from `App`: Server Components use `treaty(app).api` directly, while Client Components use the same-origin Next.js `/api/*` Route Handler. Next.js does not duplicate or rewrite API routes. TanStack Query may wrap the Eden client for client-side caching, invalidation, and mutation state.

### Data flows

Read paths are intentionally thin:

```text
PostgreSQL -> Prisma -> Elysia query route -> Eden -> Next.js
```

An Elysia query route may read Prisma directly and shape a response for that endpoint. Query logic does not pass through `@repo/application`.

Write paths preserve a usecase boundary:

```text
PostgreSQL -> Prisma -> application usecase -> Elysia mutation route -> Eden -> Next.js
```

Mutation routes validate transport input, invoke a usecase, and map the outcome to HTTP. Usecases contain business rules and Prisma transactions. Usecases do not know HTTP request or response types.

### Scheduled and asynchronous work

The boilerplate uses a PostgreSQL-backed queue, with `pg-boss` as the default implementation. It avoids a Redis dependency while retaining durable jobs, retries, delayed execution, and job state in PostgreSQL.

The scheduler and worker are distinct deployable processes:

```text
Scheduler -> enqueue named job -> PostgreSQL queue -> Worker -> application usecase -> Prisma -> PostgreSQL
```

The scheduler contains schedules, job names, and enqueue options only. It never performs business mutations itself. The worker maps each registered job name to a handler, invokes the relevant usecase, and owns retry policy, idempotency protection, and structured execution logs. API mutation routes may enqueue the same named jobs when asynchronous work follows an HTTP mutation.

## API Contract and Failures

Every business endpoint returns one response envelope:

```ts
type ApiSuccess<T> = { success: true; data: T };
type ApiFailure = {
  success: false;
  error: string;
  message: string;
  requestId?: string;
};
```

Elysia route schemas define request and response contracts. A central error handler maps validation failures, known domain/usecase errors, not-found errors, and unknown failures into the failure envelope. It returns the request ID when available and keeps sensitive internal error details out of production responses.

## Database Baseline

The current Sleekflow models, repository, and migrations are removed. `packages/database` starts with an empty Prisma schema configured for PostgreSQL and a Prisma client wrapper. Future products add models and migrations as part of their own feature work; no task-management example model is retained.

## Web Baseline

The existing auth callbacks, backend proxy, tRPC route, tRPC server modules, tRPC provider, and tRPC dependencies are removed. The root layout uses a general data-client provider where needed, not a tRPC provider. Public and dashboard pages are simple non-authenticated shells that establish route-group conventions without imposing a product domain.

## Configuration

Configuration is typed and scoped to its runtime. No application code reads `process.env` outside a dedicated config module.

`packages/config` uses `@t3-oss/env-core` and contains a shared server schema plus named config loaders:

- `createApiConfig`: common server keys, API port, and CORS configuration.
- `createWorkerConfig`: common server keys and queue/worker configuration.
- `createSchedulerConfig`: common server keys and queue/schedule configuration.

The common schema includes `NODE_ENV` and `DATABASE_URL`. API, worker, and scheduler receive individual environment files, so a process only receives values relevant to its runtime.

Next.js owns `apps/web/lib/env.ts` and uses `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`. It validates the public app origin used by browser Eden calls; Server Components use the embedded app directly. The web app never receives `DATABASE_URL`.

Tracked templates are `.env.api.example`, `.env.web.example`, `.env.worker.example`, and `.env.scheduler.example`. Their real counterparts remain ignored by Git.

## Agent Guidance

The `.agent` directory is replaced with focused Markdown rules:

- `architecture.md`: workspace ownership, permitted dependencies, data flows, and feature workflow.
- `api.md`: Elysia route organization, endpoint contracts, query/mutation boundaries, and error handling.
- `database.md`: Prisma ownership, migrations, client usage, and usecase transaction rules.
- `web.md`: `(public)` and `(dashboard)` routing, Eden-only API access, and client data conventions.
- `worker.md`: job registration, handler responsibilities, retries, idempotency, and usecase-only mutation execution.
- `scheduler.md`: schedule ownership and enqueue-only scheduling rules.
- `config.md`: typed config ownership, per-runtime environment boundaries, and T3 Env rules.

No rule may prescribe tRPC, `/nextapi`, auth/SSO, or a product-specific domain.

## Testing and Verification

- Test usecases as unit tests with focused database dependencies.
- Test Elysia routes through `app.handle` for validation, responses, and failure envelopes.
- Test job handlers and scheduler registration with a test queue boundary; assert that scheduler code enqueues work instead of executing usecases.
- Test Eden/client helpers only when they contain behavior beyond direct Eden calls.
- Run `bun test`, `bun run lint`, `bun run check-types`, and `bun run build` before declaring the migration complete.

## Feature Workflow

For each future feature:

1. Add or change the Prisma schema and create a migration.
2. Implement direct Prisma reads in its Elysia query routes.
3. Implement state changes in `@repo/application` usecases.
4. Add Elysia mutation routes that invoke those usecases.
5. When asynchronous work is needed, define a named job and worker handler that invokes the same usecase; add a scheduler registration only when it has a time-based trigger.
6. Consume the typed routes from Next.js through Eden.
7. Add focused tests at the affected boundary.
